# Project 1 - Fitting linear models to the Franke function

Files `exercise_1.py` through `exercise_6.py` contain the Python code for individual exercises, with settings & parameters at the top of the source files; `functions.py` contains helper functions and classes for the methods used across the different parts, in a functional style; `terrain.py` and `plots.py` are helpers for respectively importing terrain data from greyscale `.tif` files and plotting 3D predictions, used in exercise 6.
    
Packages NumPy, Mat Plot Lib, SciKit-Learn and ImageIO are required to run the different exercises. Latest versions of these libraries is assumed as of October 2021. Tested on Windows 10, MacOS and Ubuntu.
