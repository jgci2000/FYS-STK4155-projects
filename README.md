# FYS-STK4155-projects

This repository contains the work on projects in the UiO course Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning (FYS-STK3155/4155) by João, Jonathan, Johan Andreas Fløisand and Daniel. The course consits of three projects, and thus three different directories, each containing our solution to the respective project.

The repository will be updated as the course progresses.
